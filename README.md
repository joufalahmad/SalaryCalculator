# SalaryCalculator
This program is a simple salary calculator designed to compute the total salary of an employee based on their hourly 
wage rate and the number of hours worked. Upon execution, the user is prompted to input the hourly wage rate and the 
number of hours worked by the employee.The program calculates the base salary by multiplying the hourly wage rate by 
the number of hours worked.If the hours worked exceed 40 hours, which is the standard workweek duration, the program 
calculates overtime pay. Overtime pay is computed at a rate of 1.5 times the hourly wage rate for each hour worked beyond 
40 hours. After completing the calculations, the program displays the total salary of the employee, consisting of the base 
salary plus any overtime pay earned. Finally, the program closes the scanner object used for input.
